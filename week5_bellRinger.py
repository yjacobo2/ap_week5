# Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
# Basic Indexing:
# Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
magic = 'abracadabra'
# a. Retrieve the 5th character.
fifth_char = print(magic[4])
# b. Retrieve the second to last character.
second_to_last_char = print(magic[-2])
# c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.
first_c_index = print(magic.index('c'))
# find the last occurrence of the letter 'a'
last_a_index = print(magic.rindex('a'))
# rindex finds the last occurence of a specified value
# Advanced Slicing:
# Given the string alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# a. Extract the letters 'hij'.
hig = print(alphabet [7:10])     # output : hij
# b. Extract every second letter starting from 'a' to 'm'.
every_second = print(alphabet [0:13:2])  # output:acegikm
#get the ltter m
m_index = print(alphabet[::-1])


# c. Reverse the entire string using slicing.
revered_alphabet = print(alphabet[::-1]) #output : zyxvutsrqpomnlkjihgfedcba
I_have_a_dream = "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise upon the true meaning of its creed"
# reverse the strong
reversed_speech = print (I_have_a_dream [::-1])
# Problem Set 2: Extracting Information
# From Descriptions:
# Extract the name of the famous personality from the quote "Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. - John F. Kennedy"
famous_quote = "Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country. - John F. Kennedy"
john_f_kennedy = print(famous_quote.find("John F. Kennedy"))
# output: 83
extracted_name = print(famous_quote[83:])

# Manipulating Words:
# Given the string info = "Python is fun. Fun is good. Good is subjective.",
# a. Extract the word 'subjective' without knowing its exact position.
# b. Extract every third word.
# c. Reverse the positions of the words, but keep the characters in each word in the same order.

# Problem Set 3: String Methods
# Upper & Lower:
# Convert the following text to lowercase: "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."

# String Joining and Splitting:
# Given the list motto = ["Make", "haste", "slowly."],
# a. Convert the list into a single string.
# b. Now, split the string at every occurrence of the letter 'a'.

# Replacing Words:
# Modify the sentence: "Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans."
# a. Replace "busy" with "distracted".
# b. Replace "plans" with "mistakes".

# Problem Set 4: String Properties and Advanced Operations
# Repetition:
# Concatenate the word "Iteration" 7 times.

# Word Search:
# Check if the word "moonlight" appears in the quote: "With freedom, books, flowers, and the moon, who could not be happy? - Oscar Wilde"

# Length and Count:
# a. Calculate the number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in the word/phrase: "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
# b. Count the number of times the letter 'i' appears in the same word/phrase.
